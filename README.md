# Blockchain-based-voting-system
- Blockchain based voting system is a platform implemented on blockchain using python which can be used to cast votes (by users for different entities/parties). How a Blockchain based voting system is different from a regular one :  By implementing this Voting system using blockchain we're ensuring that this system contains most of the sercurity features that a blockhain has thus making this Voting platform more secure and tamper-proof(able to see if anything has been changed, opened, removed, or damaged)
- This is a complete project which contains two saperate blockchains, one for voter registration and the other  for vote casting. The database is stored over decentralized nodes in parts in a local network.
- Run server.py
- Run gui for  client app
